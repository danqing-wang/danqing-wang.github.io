<h1>Hello</h1>

Welcome to my personal website!
<br /> <br />

I am an assistant professor in the Department of Optical Science and Engineering, Fudan University, China. 

I received my Ph.D. degree in Applied Physics from Northwestern University, as co-advised by <a href="https://www.odomgroup.northwestern.edu/" target="_blank">Teri Odom</a> and <a href="https://sites.northwestern.edu/schatz/" target="_blank">George Schatz</a>. I earned my B.S. degree in Physics at Nanjing University, China. My research interest is in unconventional optical behaviors of functional and structured nanomaterials with applications in integrated photonics and quantum engineering. 
<br /> <br />

I was a Miller research fellow hosted by <a href="https://wu.mse.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Junqiao Wu</a> in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at University of California, Berkeley. Later I moved to Max Planck Institute for the Science of Light at <a href="https://mpl.mpg.de/divisions/sandoghdar-division" target="_blank">Sandoghdar Division</a> for quantum nanophotonics at room temperature. Please feel free to download my CV <a href="https://github.com/danqing-wang/danqing-wang.github.io/raw/master/assets/CV_DanqingWang_2025.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.   
<br /> <br />

We have openings for postdocs and graduate students to join our team. Please send your CV to danqingwang@fudan.edu.cn if interested! <br /> <br />
