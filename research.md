University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA  
Postdoctoral research hosted by Junqiao Wu  
    Highlight activities include:  
-   Achieved long-range optical interactions between epsilon-near-zero thin film materials and their analogy to superconducting proximity effect in electronic systems  
-   Demonstrated that near-zero-index materials can serve as a cladding layer for low-loss and geometry-invariant optical waveguides for miniaturized photonics  
-   Realized cavity-free lasing robust to lateral cavity geometry deformation based on zero-index materials with numerical methods  
These works are funded by the Miller research fellowship.  

Northwestern University, Evanston, IL                                                                                                   
Graduate research co-advised by Teri W. Odom and George C. Schatz   
    Highlight activities include:   
-   Achieved controlled multi-modal lasing from metal nanoparticle superlattices that enable access to multiple band-edge states in the photonic band structure  
-   Realized a mechanically tunable nanolaser based on metal nanoparticles on a flexible polymer matrix, as inspired by color changes of chameleons in nature  
-   Collaboratively demonstrated deterministic coupling of quantum emitters in hBN to plasmonic nanocavities for enhanced single-photon emission  
-   Collaboratively achieved continuous-wave nanoscale lasing at visible frequencies under near-infrared pumping with record-low power thresholds  
-   Established a robust computational approach in finite-difference time-domain methods to investigate time- and spatial- dependent lasing buildup in small photonic cavities  
These works resulted in 8 first-author publications in Nature Nanotechnology, Nature Materials, Nano Letters, ACS Photonics etc.
